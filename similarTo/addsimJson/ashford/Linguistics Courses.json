      "description": "Language is a central part of our daily lives. It is how we communicate our thoughts and desires to others. Yet, we usually take language for granted, using it effortlessly without stopping to think about how it works. So, what exactly is language, and how does it work? This course is an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. At the end of this course, students should understand what linguists study and have a good understanding of the core concepts in phonology, phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics. The developmental stages of language acquisition and the variations of dialect and style observed in spoken and written English are also examined."

      "units": "3 Credits",
      "description": "In this course, students begin to answer the questions: how do we speak, why do different languages sound distinct, and how does sound encode and convey meaning? Students will examine sounds and sound systems of languages by exploring the phonetic properties of language as well as various phonological systems that languages employ to organize these speech sounds into meaningful utterances. Students will also study selected applications of these theories.",

      "units": "3 Credits",
      "description": "How does language function in maintaining and changing power relations in modern society? What are the ways of analyzing language that can reveal these processes? How can people become more conscious of power structures, and more able to resist and change them? The relationship between language and power remains an important issue in the twenty-first century, but substantial social changes in the past decade have altered the nature of unequal power relations, and therefore the agenda for the critical study of language. This course provides an introduction to the analysis of discourse and dialogue. It brings the discussion fully up-todate by addressing the globalization of power relations and the influence of the internet and new technologies on the language of contemporary institutions and ideologies."
